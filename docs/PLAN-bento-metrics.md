# ParkSafe Bento Grid Update Plan

> **Objective:** Update the Bento Grid section in specific metrics and features requested by the user, specifically highlighting the scale of the network (7,500+ parking spots).
> **Status:** PLANNING
> **Owner:** User / Antigravity

## 1. Requirements Analysis

The user wants to pivot the "Features" Bento Grid to focus on specific network metrics and capabilities.
**Key Info to Promote:**
*   **7,500+ Parking Spots**: This needs to be a prominent feature/metric.
*   (Implied) **Infrastructure Aware Navigation**: mentioned in previous turns, likely getting a card.
*   (Implied) **Service Centers**: Mentioned in context of the network size.

**Current Grid State:**
1.  Intelligent Map Engine (Large)
2.  CCTV Rated
3.  Rapid Repair
4.  Live Traffic Data

**New Grid Concept:**
1.  **Network Scale (Large Card):** "7,500+ Parking Spots". Visualizing the density/coverage.
2.  **Service Network:** "800+ Service Centers" (if verified by user, otherwise generic "Extensive Service Network").
3.  **Smart Navigation:** "Infrastructure Aware" (Bike lanes, road types).
4.  **Security/Trust:** Retain the security rating or similar.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Revise Bento Grid Content (HomePage.tsx)
*   **Card 1 (Main/Large):** Change from "Intelligent Map Engine" to **"Hungary's Largest Cycle Network"** (or similar).
    *   Headline: "7,500+ Verified Parking Spots".
    *   Subtext: "From underground garages to street-side racks. We cover every corner."
    *   Visual: Keep map background or use a density heatmap.
*   **Card 2:** **"Infrastructure Aware"**
    *   Focus on the routing algorithm preferring bike lanes.
*   **Card 3:** **"Service Stations"**
    *   Highlight the repair network.

### Step 2: Visual Adjustments
*   Ensure the "7,500+" number is large and legible (Typography based).
*   Maintain the corporate/clean aesthetic.

## 3. Verification
*   Does the grid explicitly state "7,500+ Parking Spots"?
*   Is the tone professional?
